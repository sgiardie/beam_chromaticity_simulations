# beam_chromaticity_simulations
Simulations used for the paper "Modeling beam chromaticity for high-resolution CMB analyses"

The ``data_sacc_smooth_chromatic_beam_alpha_1/1.5/2.fits`` sacc files contain the smooth spectra with the chromatic beam effect for $`\alpha = 1/1.5/2`$. More details in the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10124.
The covariance matrix is the file ``data_sacc_w_covar_and_Bbl.fits`` (compressed)
